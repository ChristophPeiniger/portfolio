      <p>Hi,</p>
      <p>I am Chris and I am lucky to say that I am a generally happy person. Originally I am from Hamburg, Germany but recently relocated to Nairobi Kenya. </p>
      <p>Last year I got married to a beautiful and amazing woman from here, so I guess this is one of the reasons that was dragging me here. </p>
      <p>In general I would describe myself as an adventurer getting in touch with the unknown wherever possible. Discovering places cultures and opportunities are as big a part of my DNA as striving for improvement and and the joy of creating “win-win” situations are. </p>
