      <h1>My life</h1>
        <p>Hi,</p>
        <p>I am Chris and I am lucky to say that I am a generally happy person. Originally I am from Hamburg, Germany but recently relocated to Nairobi Kenya. </p>
        <p>Last year I got married to a beautiful and amazing woman from here, so I guess this is one of the reasons that was dragging me here. </p>
        <p>In general I would describe myself as an adventurer getting in touch with the unknown wherever possible. Discovering places cultures and opportunities are as big a part of my DNA as striving for improvement and and the joy of creating “win-win” situations are. </p>

      <h1>Education and Career</h1>
        <p>After school in Germany I kicked off my career in Berlin to become a operational Hotel specialist. My goal was to start a international career in beautiful five star hotels all over the world. However, as my first station after my apprenticeship I ended up in Munich, Germany. 
           Soon I learned that it takes higher education to get into top level positions so I decided to go back to school to become a Hotel Manager at some point. </p>
        <p>During my studies I got in touch with Revenue Management, the art to analyse supply and demand in order to adjust your strategies to the most profitable outcome. This really changed my perspective but I was still looking for opportunities in hotels abroad. </p>
        <p>This challenge I found in Australia, where I was staying for some time before my expiring visa forced me to leave. </p>
        <p>Instead I found the perfect opportunity back in good old Europe. I continued my career working for a Revenue Management Software provider (SaasS) in Vienna, Austria. During my time working there I deep dived into the hotel tech. world and got hooked. I love working in this field and look forward to new challenges in future... </p>

      <h1>Why did I start to code?</h1>
        <p>As I just quit my job to relocate to Kenya I was looking forward learning something new. From a podcast I was listening to (Eastern African Business Podcast) I learned about Moringa School and and Nairobi’s prominent positions as a current/future technology hub on the African continent. </p>
        <p>I wanted to know more about the energy that is created by the local technology community and in the same time broaden my own horizon. </p>
        <p>I do not know yet if I will ever actually pursue a career as a developer. However, knowing about what drives digitalization and processes behind our data driven future is an essential skill in my opinion and as important as literacy. </p>

      <h1>Hobbies and interests</h1>
        <p>I do not have “a” specific hobby like going fishing or golfing… Maybe travelling if you like to count this in. Ahhh, btw. I would never say no to delicious food and a good glass full of your finest recommendation if you get my hint ;)</p>
        <p>However, my interests are versatile and change from time to time. You could call it an episode of an hobby. Lately I was thirsty for some new skills and I want to learn some coding and web design. Apart from that I am currently very interested in how to build wealth for my family and me. I told you I just got married last year? This stuff changes you, believe me… Maybe there will be a some sort of brainchild coming from this both interests of mine, who knows? Other than that I am also up to discuss the latest real estate, stock and economic developments with you.</p>
        <p>If it comes to passion, I love everything that is done with the very same thing. I get annoyed, if something is not thought through or executed properly. Call it love for details. It is not a hobby, but my wife tells me that I complain passionately about it. </p>
