      <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
      <p>Hi,</p>
      <p>I hope you enjoy browsing through my latest projects and developments. In my portfolio you will find my very first steps in coding and web design all the way to my current and future work. </p>
      <p>I invite you to accompany me through my latest developments on my journey to become a “full stack” developer mastering several languages.</p>
      <p>I would be happy to get feedback if you take the effort to reach out. Additionally I would be happy to connect in case you are interested in hospitality, hospitality technology (PMS, RMS, CM CRS, POS etc.) Please feel free to reach out at LinkedIn as well.</p>
